            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THeſe REPORTS of that Famous and Learned Judge, Sir RICHARD HUT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, were intended long ere this to have been expoſed to publick View, as they were Originally penn'd in FRENCH by his own hand; but now (in obedience to a late Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) they are faithfully rendred into ENGLISH: And may be of great uſe and benefit to the Studients and Practiſers of the LAWES of theſe Nations.</p>
            <p>This juſt Judge (as the greateſt man (once) of this Nation was pleaſed to call him) was ſometimes Contemporary with the Lord HOBART; By reaſon whereof, though they may ſeem to meet ſometimes in Caſes, yet they part many times in the Points thereof, and the Arguments thereupon; CICERO and ROSTIUS together make one incomparable Man. And here our Learned Author appeares, not to juſtle the Chiefe Juſtice out of his place, but to continue (as he was upon the Bench) a friendly Aſſociate, and a Learned Aſſiſtant.</p>

               <p>The Plaintiff replies, and joyns Iſſue upon the Surrender and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in manner and form, and the Iſſue was tried by a <hi>Venue</hi> which came from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Iury found this ſpeciall Verdict, <hi>viz.</hi> the new Leaſe made the third of <hi>Felic:</hi> in which it is recited that ſhe had ſurrendred the Eſtate, and the Letters Patents, and the Queen as well in conſideration of the ſurrender of the Letters Patents, as in conſideration of the payment of twenty Nobles made by the new Leaſe, and the Iury found that the Demiſe made the third of <hi>Febr:</hi> was with the conſent of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Holman,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Holman</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wife agreed therto, and held in claiming by the ſaid Demiſe: And it was adjudged by the Lord <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart,</hi> and others the Iuſtices, that the Plaintiff ſhould have Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the conſideration which procured the new Leaſe is the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, and the Surrender is not abſolute but defeiſable if the wife ſurvive, or if the Husband will diſagree; and therfore the Lord <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart</hi> ſaid, that if Feme Leſſes for years takes Husband, and after the Feme takes a new Leaſe of the Queen for life, this extinguiſheth the term; but if the Husband diſagree, then the Leaſe for yeers is revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49821:14"/>The Defendant as to three hundred and eight pounds, part therof, pleaded <hi>Nil debet,</hi> to two hundred and fifteen pounds ſeventeen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings eight pence, reſidue therof, <hi>Actio non:</hi> For he ſaid, that after the Writ directed, and before the return, <hi>viz.</hi> 31 <hi>Auguſti,</hi> 14 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> the Defendant at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> paid it to the Plaintiff, upon the receit wherof, the ſame day the Plaintiff gave an Acquittance for the ſame (which he pleads) and therby acquitted and diſcharged the Defendant, and demands Iudgment if againſt his own Deed of acquittance he ſhall be received to demand the ſaid money, wherupon the Plaintiff demurred.</p>
               <p>And it was argued by Serjeant <hi>Richardſon</hi> for the Plaintiff, and by <hi>John Moore</hi> for the Defendant: An exception was taken that he could not plead <hi>Nil debet,</hi> becauſe that it is a Debt upon Record, for he is charged by the return; He is not eſtoppled to plead payment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the return, becauſe it is another Action, and the Sheriff might have paid it to the Plaintiff, though he return that he had the money ready to be delivered to him; for if he had after that paid it to the Plaintiff, that was good ſatiſfaction, and he might as well pay it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had levied it, and before the return, as he might pay it after the return, and then <hi>Nil debet</hi> is a good Plea.</p>
               <p>But it was objected, that by the return 15 <hi>Mich.</hi> that he had the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ready (and that after the acquittance) his return ſhould conclude him: And it was ſaid that it would not, for it is in another Action and ſtands therwith, 22 <hi>E:</hi> 4.38. One vouched as Heir may be bound to Warranty by his Father, and if he bring an Aſſiſe <hi>De morte Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtoris,</hi> and the Tenant plead Baſtardy, it is no Eſtoppell that the Defendant vouched him as Heir before.</p>
               <p>The Acquittance or Releaſe is good before the return, and not like unto <hi>Hoes</hi> Caſe of Bail, <hi>Coke: lib:</hi> 5.71. or 5 <hi>Eliz: Dyer</hi> 217. Releaſe of Actions and Suits will not releaſe a Covenant before it be broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> That the Acquittance or Releaſe is pleaded only by reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſ.</hi> To this it was anſwered, that he had paid the two hundred and fifty pound, ſeventeen ſhillings eight peace, which the Plaintiff had accepted, and the Plaintiff by Demurrer had confeſſed the Deed, and all that is contained therin, then it appears that he is ſatiſfied, and that the releaſe in matter as it is recited ſhall be an Eſtoppell, <hi>vide</hi> 46 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 13. But it ſeemed that it is no Eſtoppell by the reciting in the Releaſe that which is in poſſeſſion, but that afterward he might well ſay, that he was not in poſſeſſion at the time of the Releaſe, and all the Court agreed, that the Acquittance or Releaſe, and receit of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is a good Bar as to two hundred and fifteen pounds, ſeventeen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings eight pence, and ſo it was adjudged: But whether an Action of Debt lies againſt the Sheriff upon this return is queſtionable, yet that it is not any Contract, Account, or Loane, upon which three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Action of Debt lies, as it is ſaid <hi>M.</hi> 18. <hi>E.</hi> 4.23. and 41. <hi>E.</hi> 3.10. and 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3.9. When money is delivered to be delivered over, that no Debt lies if it be not delivered over, but Account, <hi>vide</hi> 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 36. a. 9 <hi>E:</hi> 4.50. And the Court inclined, that in this Caſe Debt lies, for it is a generall Contract: In <hi>Dowſes</hi> Caſe, the Sheriff levy part and do not return it, but the party pay it, Debt lies againſt the Sheriff: And if money be delivered to buy Land, if he buy it not, Debt lies, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

directed to the Coroners, and although the entry is <hi>Calumnia illa non obſtant.</hi> that is the form of the Award, and if he ſhould be allowed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe afterwards to challenge the Array, then it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
               <p>As a man ought to alledge but one principall Challenge, though he hath many, ſo it ſhall be peremptory to the Defendant, and when he allows the Sheriff indifferent, that ſhall be taken to be for all cauſes precedent, unleſſe it be of latter time: And ſo is the opinion of 20 <hi>E:</hi> 4. 2.

               <p>But it ſeems that the Law is contrary, and it is not averred that this is a Leaſe for trying the Title; and (as Iudges) we take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice therof, but <hi>vide</hi> 3 <hi>H:</hi> 7. 2. contrary to the 10 and 15 <hi>E:</hi> 4. where the Challenge is to the Array, becauſe that the Sheriff was of Kindred to him whoſe Free-hold was in Iſſue: and <hi>vide</hi> 9 <hi>H:</hi> 7. 22.

               <p>And upon argument at the Bar the Court was of opinion, that it was no principall Challenge, but ought to have concluded with the favour.

And 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 5. By <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> in a Writ of Debt brought againſt Executors, it is a good plea to ſay, that their Teſtator was Outlawed <hi>ſans luy intitle.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Vpon the reading of the Record, it ſeems that it is no plea, for it is only by Implication, and that may be given in evidence. Alſo the Executor or Adminiſtrator may have divers things which are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitable to the King; as if the Teſtator had Mortgaged his Land upon Condition, that if the Mortgagee pay not at ſuch a day to him, his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, or his Heirs, a hundred pounds, that then it ſhall be lawfull for him, or his Heirs to re-enter, and after and before the day the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is outlawed, and makes his Executors and dies, and at the day the Mortgagee pay the money to the Executors, that is Aſſets, and not forfeited is the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49821:35"/>So if Tenant for life of a Rent be outlawed, and the Rent arrear, and makes his Executors and die, this arrearage is due to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and is Aſſets, and not forfeited, for the Rent was a Free-hold, for which during his life no action of Debt lay, and theſe arrearages reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable by the Executors are Aſſets.</p>
               <p>Alſo if this ſhould be a good plea, which is only by Implication, he might therby prevent the Plaintiff of his recovery.</p>

by this act of Subſidy, but when this ends and is determined, then is the Seſſion ended, then it is a Seſſion <hi>ſcilicet</hi> a Parliament, which ought to be pleaded, at the Parliament holden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the Commiſſions of Subſidy are accordingly; and the <hi>Proviſo</hi> call it a Seſſion: Then this being done, the Lord chief Baron did not deliver any opinion, for he ſaid, that he had not conſidered the Statute; and afterward it was deſired that the Lords would deliver their opinions, and therupon the Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> declared his opinion accordingly; That it ſeemed to him that it was a Seſſion, and that it was not ſafe to meddle with ſuch Law, and that he would never refuſe to declare his opinion with his Brethren: After the Lord chiefe Iuſtice <hi>Ley</hi> made a long diſcourſe, concerning the purpoſe and intent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>ſcilicet.</hi> That it was not their purpoſe to deſtroy ſo good Lawes, and therfore it was not any ſuch Seſſion as was within the intent of the preceding Parliament, which was, that theſe ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine when it is a Parliament or Seſſion, in which good Lawes are made.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>RIchard Jennings</hi> brought an action of Covenant againſt <hi>George Pitman,</hi> upon an Indenture of an Apprentiſhip,<note place="margin">Covenant of an Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> by which the Defendant had put himſelf to be an Apprentice to the Plaintiff in <hi>Ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> to the Trade of a Linnen Draper; and there were divers clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Indenture, according to the uſuall form, and aſſigne for breach, the waſting of ſeverall ſumme of money.</p>
               <p>The Defendant pleaded the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> by which it is enacted, That it is not lawfull for any one inhabiting in any City or Towne Corporate, uſing the Trade of a Merchant over the Sea, Mercer, Pannary, Goldſmith, Iron-monger, Imbroyderer, or Clothier to take any Apprentice to be inſtructed in any of theſe Trades, if it be not his Son, or that the Father or Mother of ſuch Apprentice, had at the time of the taking of him, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance or Freehold, of forty ſhillings <hi>per annum,</hi> to be certified by three Iuſtices of Peace, under their hands and Seals where the Land lies, to the Mayor, Bayliffs, or other head Officer of the City or Town Corporate, and to be inrolled, entred, and recorded there, and pleaded the clauſe of the Statute which makes Obligations and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants void, which are taken againſt it. And averred that <hi>Ipſwich</hi> was a Town Corporate at the time of the making of the Statute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:49821:40"/>The Plaintiff replyed, that his Father had at that time when he was bound, Lands and Tenements in great <hi>Bealing, viz.</hi> ten acres, to the Value of forty ſhillings <hi>per annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Defendant by Rejoynder offer to joyn Iſſue, that his Father had not Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherupon the Plaintiff demurred.</p>
               <p>And the queſtion was, If this part of the Statute, <hi>To be certified by the Juſtices, &amp;c.</hi> be ſuch an eſſentiall part therof, that the Covenant be void without it: It was agreed, that it had not been put in uſe after the Statute; but it ſeems that it is Eſſentiall, and it ought to be ſo, at the time when he is put to be an Apprentice, but it may be enrolled afterwards, for the Statute in another part provides a penalty for the not Inrolling: Like to the Caſe upon the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> That they which claim any Eſtate of them which were Attainted in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, they brought their Conveyances to the Exchequer to be inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led within one year, if they bring and deliver theſe Conveyances, though they be not inrolled, yet they have performed as much as was in them: And if the Certificate be not at the time when the party is put to be an Apprentice, the Statute was to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If this Bar be good, then the Replication is a departure, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder alſo, and the Bar being good, Iudgment ſhall be given againſt the Plaintiff, but if the Bar be not good, then for the Plaintiff, for the Count contains matter certain.</p>
               <p>But the Court moved, whether this Covenant lay againſt an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, for although it is by the Statute provided, that he ſhall be bound to ſerve as a man of full age, yet that makes not the Covenants good, and it is like to a Cuſtom, which ſhall be taken ſtrictly.</p>

               <p>This Caſe between <hi>Jennings</hi> and <hi>Pitman</hi> was moved this Term; And the Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> was of opinion, that this Statute (being that it appears that he was within age, <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſixteen years) will not bind him to any Covenants which are not implyed in the Indenture of ſerving: For the doubt was, whether an Infant was an Apprentice out of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> though that he put himſelf to ſerve: And the only matter which binds him in this Statute, is, that he ſhall be bound to ſerve, when he is bound by Indenture, being within age, as well as if he were of full age; and if the Covenant be only a Covenant to ſerve, no Covenant lies for Imbeziling of Goods: And if the Covenant be to ſerve him faithfully and diligently, that ſhall not bind him upon this Covenant. And I was of the ſame opinion, for it is only made good as to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and there are many Covenants and Clauſes beſides in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, which bind him not; As not to play at unlawfull Games, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a Cuſtom, that an Infant at ſuch an age may ſell his Land, ſhall be taken ſtrictly, <hi>viz.</hi> that he cannot give it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But my Brother <hi>Winch</hi> was of opinion, that it was a thing incident, and a <hi>quaſi Conſequent, viz.</hi> That if he ſhall be bound to ſerve, by conſequence he ſhall be bound to ſerve faithfully and truly.

                  </note>AN Information was exhibited againſt <hi>Linley</hi> under Sheriff, to Sir <hi>Gny Palmes</hi> Sheriff of <hi>York,</hi> vpon the Statute 32 <hi>H:</hi> 6, and it was ſhewn, that he being under Sheriff, a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> was delivered to him, to Arreſt one <hi>Francis Lancaſter</hi> upon a Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a hundred and three pounds: The Defendant <hi>Colore officii</hi> took of the Plaintiff thirty ſhillings for making of a Warrant upon this Writ, againſt the form of the Statute, wherby he hath forfeited forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Vpon not guilty pleaded, and Verdict againſt the Defendant, it was alledged in arreſt of Iudgment, that the making of a Warrant upon a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> which is for Execution, is not within the Statute, becauſe the Statute ſpeaks firſt, of Fees to be taken upon the Arreſt of the party, when he is bailed, <hi>viz.</hi> twenty pence to the Sheriff, and four pence to the Baily, then appoints that the Sheriff lets to Bail every one that is taken upon Bill or Plaint, beſides them which are taken for execution, Outlawry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then comes the clauſe, That nothing ſhall be taken for making of any Precept, or Warrant, but four pence; and proviſion for the Obligation, Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Fee, and that all Obligations taken by any Sheriff <hi>Colore officii,</hi> that theſe ſhall be void, and that for every offence committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Statute, he ſhall forfeit forty pounds.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> inclined, that this making of the Warrant upon the <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> and the taking of thirty ſhillings is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Statute; and he reſembled it to <hi>Dive</hi> and <hi>Maninghams</hi> caſe in <hi>Plowden,</hi> where an Obligation taken of one in Execution is void by this Statute: <hi>vide,</hi> that the clauſe in this Statute for the Obligation is abſolute, without any reſtraint, but that all obligations taken by colour of his Office, with any other Conditions are made void.</p>
               <p>This taking of thirty ſhillings for making of a Warrant upon a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> is extortion at the Common Law, for which he may be indited, but whether it be within this Statute or no is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>Another Exception was taken to this Information; That it doth not appear by this, that this Writ of <hi>Capias</hi> was directed to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of <hi>York,</hi> or to any other Sheriff: And then admitting this to be a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> directed to the Sheriff of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by an ignorant hand to the Sheriff of <hi>York,</hi> to make a Precept therupon, and he makes a Precept, and takes thirty ſhillings, this is not within the Statute; alſo <hi>Colore officii</hi> will not ſerve, for it is generall, and it ought to be ſhewn that it was a <hi>Capias,</hi> and to whom it was directed: And although that all Proceſſe ſhould be generally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Sheriff, yet ſome may be to the Coroners, or ſome (by the miſ-priſion of the Clerks) may be omitted; as <hi>Jacobus Dei gratia &amp;c. tibi precipimus,</hi> and ſay not, <hi>Vice-Comiti Eboracenſi ſalutem.</hi> And an Information ought to be certain to all common intents, and it is like to an Indictment.

               <p>This Term Serjeant <hi>Finch</hi> moved the caſe, and prayed Iudgment, for he ſaid, the ancient Books were many for Iudgment conditionally; but ſome to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Heir is vouched within the ſame County, and is within age, there Iudgment preſently againſt

               <p>The Court adjudged this caſe for the Demandant, upon view of the ſaid Preſident of 38, <hi>&amp;</hi> 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> And as this caſe is, the Demandant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſity ought to have Execution, becauſe that the Tenant which ought to have the benefit of the Warranty made default: And if it was ſo that the Vouchee was dead, the Tenant ſhall not have any other Voucher, for the Dower ought not to ſuffer delay: And likewiſe when Iudgment is given againſt the Tenant, with a <hi>Ceſſet executio,</hi> all is one, as a conditionall Iudgment againſt the Tenant, for if Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets be found, then <hi>Quia compertum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> with Iudgment againſt the Heir, and that the Tenant ſhall hold in peace.</p>
               <p>It was objected, that Iudgment ought to be conditionally at firſt, and not to give one Iudgment againſt the Tenant, and afterwards if Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets be found, another Iudgment againſt the Heir; but that is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.

                  <hi>I doubt not but to prove that the Plaintiff hath ſpoken Treaſon (<hi>Innuendo</hi> Treaſon againſt the King:</hi>) Verdict was found for the Plaintiff; And it was moved in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Iudgment, that theſe words are not actionable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe no time is alledged when the Plaintiff is ſuppoſed to ſpeak Treaſon, and it might be when he was an Infant, or that it is pardoned: To which it was anſwered by the Court; Firſt, That theſe words ought to be alledged as they were ſpoken, and that was <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite. 2.</hi> The time is not materiall, unleſſe the Defendant make it materiall by his plea, <hi>viz.</hi> When he was in giving Evidence for the King againſt a Traytor, and then he repeated ſuch words; or when that the Plaintiff was frantick, and of that he intended, and ſo juſtifie, there the time may come in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Exception was, that there is not any expreſſe affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: to that it was anſwered by the Court, that it was more then an Affirmative, for he had (as he ſaid) proof therof, and not a report or hearſay: And if one ſay, it is reported, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that will not bear action, unleſſe he juſtifie the report, by charging it upon him which was the Author of the report.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Alſo it was objected, that the ſpeaking of treaſon was not treaſon; But it was holden clearly, that it is as well as Preaching, or writing, <hi>Et Index animi Sermo.</hi>

                  <hi>THomas Flight</hi> brought an action upon the caſe againſt <hi>Greſh;</hi> and count, that wheras the Plaintiff and one <hi>Baleman</hi> were bound in an Obligation to the Defendant,<note place="margin">In conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Obligor pay the ſumm, the Obligee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Bill.</note> for the payment of ſuch a ſumm at ſuch a day: The Defendant in conſideration that the Plaintiff would pay to him the laid ſumm at the day, aſſumed to deliver the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Plaintiff, and ſhewed that he had paid the money at the day, and the Defendant did not deliver it, but after ſued it and recovered, and had the Plaintiff in priſon in execution by the ſpace of a year.</p>
               <p>The Defendant <hi>proteſtando,</hi> that he did not aſſume, for plea ſaith, that the Plaintiff did not pay it; and therupon Iſſue, and found for the Plaintiff. And it was moved by Serjeant <hi>Gwin,</hi> that this action lies not for want of conſideration, for the Plaintiff did nothing but that which he was obliged to do, and no profit to the Defendant, for if he had not paid the ſumm, the Obligation had been forfeited: And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled it to the caſe of 9 <hi>E:</hi> 4. 19. An accord (in Treſpaſſe) that the Defendant ſhould deliver to the Plaintiff his Evidences, and permit him to enter into his Land, is no good Bar: So in an Arbitrement, 12 <hi>H:</hi> 7. that the one permit the other which was diſſeiſed to enter, and that he ſhould give to him his Charters and Evidences, is not good: And he vouched one to be reſolved in the Kings Bench,<note place="margin">Greenwood <hi>and</hi> Becket.</note> between <hi>Greenwood</hi> and <hi>Becket,</hi> where one had forfeited three Bills, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that the Plaintiff will pay the three ſeverall ſumms three daies after, he would deliver them to the Plaintiff: And the Court was of opinion that it was no ſufficient conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richardſon</hi> to the contrary, and ſaid that the payment without Suit, was for the advantage of the Obligee, to be ſure of his money, and may be more available to him at this time, then the forfeiture afterwards: And he vouched a Caſe to be adjudged, that where one had bought, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in a Market, and had paid for them, and the party which had bouoght them (becauſe that he which bought them had them in poſſeſſion, and would not deliver them) in conſideration that the party would deliver them, promiſed to pay him a certain ſumm, an action lies therupon.</p>
               <p>And the opinion of the Court was, that the action lay, for (for any thing that appears) the monies were paid before the time that in Law they might be paid, <hi>viz.</hi> before the ſetting of the Sun: And it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, if a man to whom money is to be paid, come to the party the ſame day, and pray him to pay it in the morning, and that in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49821:46"/>
therof, promiſe to pay him five pounds, to abate five pounds, or to deliver an Obligation, this is good: And a voluntary promiſe to do that which is in good conſcience good and juſt for him to do, ſhall bind him, and the rather becauſe he had benefit, <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſure of the performance: And the forfeiture is but means to obtain the principall ſumm: And if one had Iudgment, and in conſideration that he will not ſue execution, the other promiſe to pay, it is good: And becauſe that in this caſe it appears, that by the non-performance of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the Plaintiff had prejudice, and the Iury had found <hi>ſolvit,</hi> the Plaintiff had Iudgment.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49821:47"/>
ſo is Common Experience (after the Statutes) which is the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the Law: And if it ſhould be otherwiſe, Executors would be diſcouraged to bring actions for the debts of their Teſtator.</p>
               <p>And Iuſtice <hi>Harvy</hi> was of the ſame opinion, but Iuſtice <hi>Yelverton</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi> to the contrary: And they agreed, that in all actions brought by Executors, upon Contracts, Obligations, or other things made to the Teſtator, there ſhall be no coſts, for that is not within the Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> Contracts, or Specialties made to the Plaintiff; or if an action be <hi>De bonis aſportatis</hi> in the life of the Teſtator, or upon any Tort ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be done not immediatly to the Plaintiff, there ſhall be no coſts, becauſe that the Statute gives not coſts in theſe caſes, 20 <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> Debt upon a Demiſe for years, if the Plaintiff ſhall be Non-ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there ſhall be coſts, for it is upon Contract, though in ſome ſort reall. But in this caſe, though the Plaintiffs are named Executors, and their Title is derived from their Teſtator, yet the action is brought upon an immediate Tort done to themſelves; and it is within the very words of the Statute: and this Statute which is to prevent Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Suits, ſhall be taken favourably.</p>
               <p>If Executors have a Leaſe for years, and they demiſe it rendring rent, and for Rent arrear they bring an action, it ſhall be in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> and <hi>Detinet,</hi> and they ſhall pay coſt; if they be Non-ſuited, and yet their Title is as Executors, but it is founded upon their own Contract, ſo if they bring an action of Treſpaſſe for the taking of Goods which came to their poſſeſſion, which Goods were in truth tortiouſly taken by the Teſtator, and he died poſſeſſed therof, and they being Non-ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they ſhall pay coſts: And Executors in actions brought againſt them ſhall pay coſts, and if they have no Goods of the Teſtator, it ſhall be <hi>De bonis propriis.</hi> And <hi>vide,</hi> that upon Contracts made by them, or Rent arrear in their time, the action ſhall be in the <hi>Debet</hi> and <hi>Detinet, vide Coke lib:</hi> 5, <hi>Hergraves</hi> caſe.

               <p>The Defendant confeſſed all the Inducement, and alſo a promiſe <hi>ſub modo,</hi> and ſayd, that the ſaid <hi>Palmer</hi> had brought Treſpaſſe, to which the Plaintiff had pleaded Not guilty, <hi>abſque hoc,</hi> that the ſaid ſuit and tryall was for the ſaid Common; And Iſſue being joyned it was found for the Plaintiff, and Damages to twenty pounds. And in Arreſt of Iudgment it was moved, that now it appears, that it was not for the maintenance of the Title of Common, &amp; that it could not be for the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all therof, becauſe he did not plead the Title of Common, which had been the proper &amp; apt way for the tryall therof: And when the Iury find that which is contrary and repugnant to Law, that is repugnant and not good. And this caſe was ſtrongly argued by Serjeant <hi>Davenport</hi> in Arreſt of Iudgment, and by <hi>Attho</hi> for the having of Iudgment: And firſt he ſaid, That although there was a Parlance and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication concerning the Common, yet the promiſe is to defend this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction brought by <hi>Palmer,</hi> and is <hi>pro defentione</hi> of the Common, not generally, but againſt <hi>Palmer,</hi> and the promiſe is to pay the Moyety of the Charges, if he proſecute the ſaid Suit, untill the determination therof, ſo that if it had been found againſt the now Plaintiff, the now Defendant ought to have paid the Moyety of the ſaid charges: And it is not agreed that he ſhall plead title by Preſcription for the Common, but that he ſhould proſecute it untill the determination of the Suit, for the maintenance of the Common. And the Court gave Iudgment for the Plaintiff, for it might be for the maintenance of their Common againſt <hi>Palmer,</hi> for if he had not the Soil therof, but had incloſed it as part of his Waſts, the Plaintiff could not plead the Title to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon without admitting the Soil and Free-hold to be in <hi>Palmer:</hi> And if one had been of councell, and to adviſe a Plea, if he had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that <hi>Palmer</hi> had no Title, he would have adviſed him to have pleaded Not guilty; for if the ſaid <hi>Palmer</hi> had no Title to the Soil (which the now Plaintiff could not know) it ſhould be found againſt him; and ſo this Plea might have been in maintenance of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>And the Lord <hi>Richardſon</hi> who at firſt doubted, now concurred, and ſayd, that he was fully ſatisfied.</p>

               <p>One reaſon in this caſe is, becauſe that by the ſurrender which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, the Contract is determined, and that is by the act of both.</p>
               <p>And by the ſurrender the Eſtate for years is extinguiſht to all purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as to that to which the ſurrender was made; as if he had granted a Rent, now it ſhall commence, and he is ſeiſed in Fee, and may hold it charged with both the Rents, 2 <hi>H:</hi> 5. 7. 5 <hi>H:</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 15.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cuſtom, that the Lord have a Feild-courſe over the Lands of his Coppyholders if the Tenant incloſe it is no forfeifture.</note>Barnard Vtber <hi>ſeiſed of the ſaid Land to him and his Heirs by Copy of Court-Roll, according to the Cuſtom of the Mannor of</hi> Binham: <hi>And that within that Mannor there is ſuch a Cuſtom, that the Lord had had one field courſe for five hundred Ewes in the North-field, and the Weſt-field (wherof theſe fifteen acres were parcell) from the Feaſt of Saint</hi> Michael, <hi>if the Corn were inned, and if it were not, then after the Corn were inned, untill the Feaſt of the Annunciation, if it were not before that time ſown again with Corn, in all the Lands of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyholders not incloſed. And that it is a Cuſtom, that no Copyholder may incloſe any Copyhold Land without the Licenſe of the Lord: And if any be incloſed without Licenſe, then a reaſonable fine ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Lord or his Steward, for the Incloſure, if the Lord would accept therof. And it is alſo a Cuſtom that if the Lord will not accept therof, then the Copyholder which ſo incloſeth, ſhall be puniſhed at every Court after, untill he open that Incloſure. And the ſaid</hi> Vtber
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49821:59"/>
                  <hi>incloſed the</hi> 15. <hi>acres with an Hedge and Fence of Quick-ſet,</hi> 3. <hi>feet deep, and</hi> 6. <hi>feet broad; and that he had left</hi> 4. <hi>ſpaces of</hi> 9. <hi>feet broad in the ſaid</hi> 15. <hi>acres: And that the ſaid</hi> Vtber <hi>was required by the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to lay open the ſaid Incloſure, and he did it not, whereupon there was a command to the Bayliff to ſeiſe them as forfeit, which was done; And the ſaid</hi> Mary <hi>being Seignoreſs of the Mannor entred, and leaſed to the Plaintiff, and the Defendant entred upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Davenport</hi> argued that it is a forfeiture, and againſt the Cuſtom which creates the Feildage for the Lord, as well as the Eſtate of Copyhold for the Tenant, and that this leaving of four ſpaces is a fraud and device; and that it is againſt his Fealty, and is to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Lord, and a thing unlawfull, <hi>vide Dyer</hi> 245. 34 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon</hi> 88. 15 <hi>A:</hi> 7. 10. 29 <hi>E:</hi> 3. 6. That if the Tenant incloſe, the Commoner may break his hedges. And though by <hi>Littleton</hi> an Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is a Diſſeiſin, is a totall Incloſure, wherby he which hath the rent cannot come to diſtrain, yet this alſo is an Incloſure, becauſe that it obſtructs the feild-courſe, for they cannot come ſo freely, without interuption or damage, for the hedges may deprive the Sheep of their wooll: And he compared it to the caſe of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 4. One is obliged to make an Eſtate of his Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi> if he alien part and then make a Feoffment, the Condition is broken, and <hi>vide</hi> 5 <hi>E:</hi> 3. <hi>fol:</hi> 58. a Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance with Condition to make a Feoffment to <hi>I. S.</hi> of the Mannor, if he alien part therof, he forfeit his Recognizance, he vouched 42 <hi>E:</hi> 2. 5. and <hi>Coke lib:</hi> 4. that deniall of Services, or making of Waſt is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture. 22 <hi>H:</hi> 6. 18. 41 <hi>E:</hi> 3. <hi>Waſt</hi> 82. <hi>Dyer</hi> 364. And though that the Lord may proceed by fiue to enforce him to lay it open, yet theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Cuſtoms do not toll the Negative. And to prove that the Lord had an Inheritance therin, he vouched 14 <hi>E:</hi> 2. <hi>Fitz. Grant</hi> 92. A Rent granted to one and his Heirs, out of the Mannor of <hi>Dale,</hi> which he hold of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> this is an Inheritance. And if this ſhall not be a forfeiture, then this Cuſtomary Inheritance, which the Lord had in the feild-courſe, might be tolled at the will and pleaſure of the Copyholder. Serjeant <hi>Hitcham</hi> argued ſtrongly to the contrary. Firſt, That it is no Incloſure, becauſe that all is not incloſed. Secondly, The forfeiture of a Copyhold is alwaies by ſome thing done to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyhold land it ſelf, but this is done (as it is ſuppoſed) to the feild-courſe of the Lord, which is not Copyhold, and it is better for the Copyhold, and makes the land better, and alſo the Feild-courſe is therby made better, and more beneficiall to the Lord; and therfore the Copyhold land is not altered, but is meliorated, and it is like ſo the caſe in <hi>Dyer</hi> 361. <hi>Althams</hi> caſe, after no Waſt done, the Evidence was, that a Trench was made in a Meadow, by which the Meadow was Meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and adjudged no waſt, which might be given in evidence: But he ſaid that in <hi>Brooks</hi> caſe, at the firſt comming of <hi>Popham</hi> to be chief Iuſtice, it was adjudged, that if a Copyholder build a new houſe, it is a forfeiture, for that altoreth the nature of the thing, and put the Lord to more charge. So if Tenant for yeare makes a Hay-yard in the land, that is waſt. He ſaid, that this Cuſtom is qualified by taking a Fine, if he would, or by impoſing a pain in the Court, to enforce the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to lay it open. And all the Court were of opinion, that this is no forfeiture, for the reaſons before; and that this Feild-courſe is a thing which commence by agreement, and is but a Covenant, and not of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right: And Forfeitures (which are odious in Law) ſhall be taken ſtrickly.</p>

               <p>And the Lord <hi>Richardſon</hi> was of opinion,<note place="margin">Arrearages of Rent reſerved by Indenture is not within the act of 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> of Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> that Iudgment ſhould be given againſt the Plaintiff, becauſe the Statute of the 21. of King <hi>James, cap.</hi> 16. extends to Debts for arrearages of Rent expreſly.</p>

               <p>Another reaſon was, that Statutes are not made to extend to thoſe caſes which ſeldom or never happen, as this caſe is, but to thoſe that frequently happen.</p>

               <p>The Defendant avowed as Bayliff to Sir <hi>William Sheapherd,</hi> and derived Title by a Leaſe to <hi>Michael Weſt</hi> for ninety years, if he and <hi>Thomas Weſt</hi> the Defendant,<note place="margin">Demand of Rent.</note> and one <hi>Hutton Weſt</hi> ſhould ſo long live: And the ſaid <hi>Michael,</hi> 19. <hi>Aprilis, An:</hi> 20 <hi>Jac.</hi> granted a Rent-charge of ten pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to the ſaid <hi>William Shepheard</hi> and his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, out of the place in which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the reſidue of his Tearm, to be paid at the houſe of <hi>Thomas Weſt</hi> in <hi>S.</hi> And the ſaid <hi>Mich.</hi> granted, that if the Rent he arrear by eight and twenty daies, being lawfully deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the ſaid houſe, he ſhould forfeit twenty ſhillings for every day, that it ſhould he arrear, and if it be arrear by ſix months, being lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demanded at the ſaid houſe, then he might diſtrain for that, and the <hi>Nomine poenae:</hi> And for Rent arrear by a year after demand due, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he makes Conuzance; And therupon the Plaintiff demurred gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls.</p>
               <p>And after many Arguments at Bar, the Iuſtices delivered ſhortly their opinions ſeverally, and all argued that it is a Rent-charge: and then a Diſtreſſe is incident to a Rent-charge, which is in its crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Rent-charge; as well as if one makes a Leaſe for life or years, rendring Rent, and if it be lawfully demanded, then it ſhall be lawfull to diſtrain for it. None will deny, but that he may diſtrain for this Rent, without any demand: And the diverſity is between a Penalty and a Rent, for if the Avowry had been for any part of the <hi>Nomine poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> then without actuall demand at the day he could not have diſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therfore, <hi>vide Maunds</hi> caſe, <hi>Coke lib:</hi> 7. <hi>fol:</hi> 28.

It was agreed, that if Rent he reſerved at the time of the Diſtreſſe, and it be refuſed, and a Diſtreſſe taken, that is Tortious, 30 <hi>Aſſ:</hi> 36. 20 <hi>H:</hi> 6. 31. 48 <hi>E:</hi> 3. 9. 2 <hi>H:</hi> 6. 4.</p>

                     <p>But as he ſaid to me, their opinions we delivered only upon this caſe and upon theſe examinations, if the Lords gave credit to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in fact, that it was Buggery, but they gave not a generall opinion, that may be a rule in other caſes, but upon the foulneſſe and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of this Fact.</p>
                     <p>And afterwards the Lords were not unanimouſly reſolved that it was Buggery, but this Point was reſolved, that they ought to believe and give credit to the Law, as the Iudges had declared it. And it ſeems that they could not give a ſpeciall Verdict upon this tryall, for it never was ſeen: Alſo the Commiſſion determines after Iudgment given, And the Staff of the high Steward ſhall be broken.</p>

                     <item>2. The Record it ſelf comes not but a Tranſcript.</item>
                     <item>3. The Statute of <hi>34 H: 8.</hi> hath appointed the Execution, and that ſhould be purſued.</item>

When Iudgment in a peculiar inferiour Court, comes into the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> or into this Court by Writ of Error, and is affirmed, then the Superiour ſupplies it, and add ſtrength to the Iudgment: But when Iudgment is given in a Court of a Corporation, and that is removed by <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and ſent by <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus,</hi> that ſhall not be executed there, <hi>vide</hi> 45 <hi>E:</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Formedon</hi> in <hi>London, vide</hi> 14 <hi>E:</hi> 3. <hi>Tryals</hi> 23. 15 <hi>E:</hi> 3. <hi>Record</hi> 35.

               <p>Margaret Sanders <hi>ſeiſed in Fee, makes a Feoffment to the uſe of her ſelf for life, without impeachment of Waſt, and after to the uſe of the Feeoffees for eighty years, if one</hi> Nicholas Sanders <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth <hi>his Wife ſhould live ſo long, and if the ſaid</hi> Elizabeth <hi>ſurvive</hi> Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las <hi>her Husband, then to the uſe of the ſaid</hi> Elizabeth <hi>for life, without impeachment of Waſt, and after the deceaſe of the ſaid</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>to the uſe of</hi> Poſtumus Sanders, <hi>Son of the ſaid</hi> Nicholas <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth <hi>in tail: And for default of ſuch Iſſue, to the uſe of</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>Wife of the ſaid</hi> Iohn Napper <hi>and</hi> Dorothy Sanders, <hi>and the ſaid</hi> Francis Sanders <hi>one of the Leſſors, and to the Heirs of their bodies, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the right Heirs of</hi> Margaret <hi>the Feoffor: And there was a clauſe in the ſaid Indenture, that the intent of the Eſtate for years to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees was, that the ſaid</hi> Elizabeth Sanders <hi>might have the profits, and not</hi> Nicholas <hi>her Husband, who was a Prodigall.</hi> Margaret Sanders <hi>dies, and</hi> Dorothy <hi>dies without Iſſue, the Feoffee enter,</hi> Elizabeth Sanders <hi>dies,</hi> Nicholas <hi>is yet alive, and</hi> Poſthumus <hi>dies without Iſſue,</hi> Iohn Napper <hi>and his Wife, and the ſaid</hi> Francis <hi>entred and were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, untill the Defendant as Son and Heir of the ſaid</hi> Margaret, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and ouſted them. <hi>Et ſi ſuper totam Materiam, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:49821:67"/>And the ſole queſtion was, whether the remainder in tail to <hi>Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and the remainder in tail to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> were contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or executed: And it was reſolved by all the Court, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders were not contingent in the Eſtate for life which was to come to <hi>Elizabeth Sanders,</hi> the Wife of the ſaid <hi>Nicholas,</hi> but were veſted preſently. And it was agreed, that the Eſtate for life, if ſhe ſurvive her Husband, was contingent; and when that had hapned, being by way of Limitation of an uſe, it ſhall be interpoſed when the Contingent happen, as in <hi>Chudleys</hi> caſe, <hi>Coke lib: 1. fol:</hi> 133. a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the uſe of the Feoffor for life, and after his death to his firſt Son which ſhall be afterwards born, for his life, and ſo to divers: And afterwards to the uſe of <hi>I.

And in this caſe it was a good Eſtate for life in <hi>Margaret:</hi> And then gives the remane in the Feoffees for eighty years,, if <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Sanders</hi> ſo long ſhould live, and if <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſurvive <hi>Nicholas,</hi> then to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for her life, and after her deceaſe to <hi>Poſthumus</hi> in tail, and after his deceaſe to the ſaid three Daughters in tail, ſo that there the Eſtate for years determines upon the death of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo alſo the Eſtate for life to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> which was contingent, determines by his death.</p>
               <p>And the Lord <hi>Darbies</hi> caſe, a Feoffment to the uſe of <hi>Edward,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Derbies</hi> caſe.</note> late Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> in tail, and then to the uſe of the two Feoffees for eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, if <hi>Henry</hi> late Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> ſhould ſo long live, and after his deceaſe to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and to the Heirs Males of his body, and for default of ſuch Iſſue, to the uſe of <hi>William</hi> now Earl of <hi>Derby.</hi> And it was adjudged that the remainders veſt preſently: And this poſſibility that <hi>Henry</hi> might have over lived the eighty years, will not make the remainders contingent.

               <p>And after many motions in Arreſt and praying of Iudgment, it was reſolved, that this act was done by them as Iudges, and for this Iudiciall Act no action lay: And though that the Bail by the event ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be inſufficient, yet there is no remedy by action upon the caſe, it being without fraud or corruption, and not for reward.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>One receives Preſſe-money to ſerve the King in his Wars, and is in the Kings Wages, and with others is delivered to a Conductor, to be brought to the Sea-ſide, and with-draweth himſelf and runneth away without licenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queſtion was, if it were Felony.</p>
               <p>And time being given before to adviſe concerning it, all agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Yelverton</hi> and my ſelf that it was Felony.</p>
               <p>And the ſole queſtion is, if a Conductor be a Captain within the 7 <hi>H:</hi> 7. <hi>cap:</hi> 1. and the 3 <hi>H:</hi> 8. <hi>cap:</hi> 5. And they ſaid, that it is not neceſſary that he ſhould be ſuch a Captain as is to lead and command them in the War, or that hath skill to inſtruct; But ſuch as hath the leading of them by agreement, between the Deputy Lievtenants, and them, and that ought to provide for the Billeting of them, and to carry them to the place of Randeſvous. And one part of a Captain is to conduct, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that <hi>Conduxit</hi> be properly to hire a Souldier, yet this name Conductor, with whom it is ſo agreed by Indenture to conduct the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, is a Captain, within the intent of thoſe Statutes; and if it ſhould not be ſo, theſe Statutes (which are for the defence of the Realm) ſhall be of little force.</p>
               <p>But it was agreed by them, that if theſe Conductors (which are ſo called of late times) be hired to carry them but to one place, and there another Conductor to receive them, this is not within the Statute; And it ought to be ſuch a Conductor that can give licenſe upon juſt cauſe to proceed. It was ſaid, that they uſed to ſend Captains into the Country, but then they were ſo chargable to the Country, and full of diſorder, that upon complaint of the Iuſtices of Peace, about 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> this courſe was invented, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Deputy Lievtenants ſhould provide for them that were preſſed, for Coats and Conduct, and they ſent their Souldiers to a place appointed to be delivered to certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom the Queen appointed, to receive them. And it was ſaid, that though this Caſe as it is propounded might be cleer, yet there are many Circumſtances which ought to be proved, and that are loft to the diſcretion of them before that he ſhould be tryed.</p>
               <p>It was unanimouſly agreed, that if one takes Preſſe-money, and when he ſhould be delivered over, he withdraw himſelf, that is not Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, although he is hired and retained to ſerve.</p>
               <p>But my Brother <hi>Yelverton</hi> &amp; I were of opinion, that this new name newly invented, is not Captain within theſe penall Statutes, which ought to be taken ſtrictly, <hi>vide Plowden</hi> 86. that penalties which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern life ſhall not be taken by equity, but if they be within the words of the Statute, then they ſhall: As to kill his Miſtreſſe, is within the words, for Miſtreſſe is Maſter.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon was, that the Statutes provide puniſhment for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which want of their number, or which pay not their Souldiers
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49821:75"/>
within ſix daies after they have received their pay, upon pain of forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all their Goods: And the Statute did not intend other Captains in this point, then was in the former and latter part therof.</p>
               <p>But admitting that a Conductor is ſuch a one to whom the Souldiers are delivered by Indenture with all Covenants uſuall, <hi>viz.</hi> To pay to them their Wages, and to convey them to their appointed place, and that he may give licenſe to depart; yet they agreed, that it is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and clearer way that they ſhould be made Captains, and ſo named in the Indentures, for the King may change the Captain at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and then it ſhould be no queſtion.</p>
               <p>It was agreed, that 7 <hi>H:</hi> 7. <hi>cap:</hi> 1. extends only to them who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſſed to ſerve the King upon the Sea, or upon the Land beyond the Sea; And the Statute of 3 <hi>H:</hi> 8. <hi>cap:</hi> 5. adds only the Land here: And the Statute makes departure without licenſe from the Captain Felony, and the Statute 3 <hi>H:</hi> 8. without licenſe from the Lievtenant: And the Statute of 7 <hi>H:</hi> 7. makes the tryall to be in the County where they ſhall be taken before the Iuſtices of the Shire, as they may try other Felonies within their Commiſſion: The Statute of 3 <hi>H:</hi> 8. makes their tryall before the Iuſtices of the County, where they are taken; and this being a new Felony and made tryable againſt the Common Law (which appoint tryals by Iurors of the County where the Fact is committed) and appoint a ſpeciall Iudge, <hi>viz.</hi> Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace, that is only tryable before them, and not before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> who cannot try any thing, but that which is done in the ſame County: But this, if all be not done in that County where they are taken, makes it tryable only before the Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace of the County where they are taken.</p>
               <p>In this point all were not reſolved, but required longer-time, <hi>vide</hi> 2 <hi>Inſt</hi> 56.</p>
